- **ðŸ’¡ Principal Component Analysis**: 
- PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that enables you to identify the correlations and patterns in the dataset so that it can be transformed into a dataset of significantly lower dimensions without any loss of important information. It is an unsupervised statistical technique used to examine the interrelations among a set of variables. It is also known as a general factor analysis where regression determines a line of best fit. It works on a condition that while the data in a higher-dimensional space is mapped to data in a lower dimension space, the variance or spread of the data in the lower dimensional space should be maximum.
- PCA is carried out in the following steps
      1. Standardization of Data
      2. Computing the covariance matrix
      3. Calculation of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues
      4. Computing the Principal components
      5. Reducing the dimensions of the Data.
